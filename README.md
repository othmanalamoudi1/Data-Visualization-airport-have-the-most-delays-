# Data Visualization | Which airport have the most delays in 2015?

This data comes from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays" target="_blank">Kaggle dataset</a> , it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. I will let the map and graph communicate the insights instead of words. Feel free to download the raw data & the Power BI file where I built the visualization.

I took the analysis one step farther and asked myself What causes delays to departure from the airport? After looking closling, I found weather is the main cause. Here is my finding:

Again, I decided to dive deeper to if those delay ( weather delay ) vary by time of year? Here are my findings:
