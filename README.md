# Data Visualization | airport have the most delays

This data comes from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays" target="_blank">Kaggle dataset</a> , it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. I will let the map and graph communicate the insights instead of words. Feel free to download the raw data & the Power BI file where I built the visualization.
